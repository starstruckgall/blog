The command prompt, or 'cmd' for short, allows users to interact with their computer system by entering commands for the computer to follow.

### What kind of commands?

Sorry, but no you can not ask your computer to turn you into the next president of America (unless your name is Donald Trump of course) but you can get it do to some pretty awesome stuff.

From making you look like a real hacker to helping you install packages for Python, using the command line can give you endless amounts of opportunities.

### So how do I use it?

Well, the command line is specifically designed for the Windows system so if you are using a Windows machine then it's pretty easy. Just use the command prompt shortcut by accessing your cmd through the start menu or app screen of your windows. Type cmd and you should be able to view the command line app shortcut.

If all goes well you should be directed to such a screen:

Now just type in your commands at the input line where your cursor is blinking. That's pretty much all you have to do to start using the command line. Let's begin with our first command, shall we?

### Our first command in the prompt

Let's start by creating a new text file simply by telling our computer to create one. We're going to get our command prompt to interact with Notepad and create a new file. Here is the command:

```powershell
notepad filename.extension
```

Replace the filename with the name of the file you wish to create and the extension should be the .txt if you are creating a text file.

Congratulations!
