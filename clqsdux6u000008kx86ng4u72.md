To create an image element in HTML we need to use a self-closing img tag.

```xml
 <img>
```

Now that your webpage knows to load an image you have to tell it which image to load. To do that we are going to specify the URL address of the image we want to display using the src attribute.

```xml
<img src="">
```

Inside the double quotes of our src attribute, we are going to paste the URL of the image we want to display.

```xml
<img src="https://wallpapers.com/images/thumbnail/kimetsu-no-yaiba-pictures-ekypmhesa3ghjw9r.webp">
```

The image is now displayed in my webpage:

Note: If the image is not displaying make sure that the src attribute contains the URL of the picture's image address and not the link address.

That's all it takes to create an image element in HTML. To set the image to the desired size you will need to use some CSS styling.

All the best -Esther.
